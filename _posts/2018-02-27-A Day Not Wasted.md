I was quite irritated with my work and was not even feeling like to see or talk anything worth. So, I thought let's waste a day and just keep lying in bed but I got bored and was not even getting sleep even after trying really hard :) Then, I decided to watch a movie. 

I started with a 2015 movie named **Proof**. It was a nice short movie but I was still not getting sleep and I started with another movie **Gifted**. This one was very good and it took away all my sleep and ended up watching three more movie back to back. I could write the reviews about these movies but I feel people on rotten tomatoes and imdb has already done a good job. I liked all the five movies I saw today and I recommend that you can pick any one of these and trust me your time will not regret. 

#### So, It was not a day wasted instead day well spent :)
