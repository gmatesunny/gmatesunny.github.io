I was quite irritated with my work and did not even feel like seeing or talking about anything worthwhile. So, I thought letâ€™s waste a day and just keep lying in bed but I got bored and was not even getting sleep even after trying hard :) Then, I decided to watch a movie.
I started with a 2015 movie named Proof. It was an average movie but I was still not getting any sleep. I started with another movie Gifted. This one was very good and it took away all my sleep and I ended up watching three more movies back to back. I could write reviews about these movies but I feel people on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb have already done a good job. 

#### So, It was not a day wasted instead day well spent :)

I liked all the five movies I saw today. I could recommend that you pick any one of these and trust me you will not regret it.
